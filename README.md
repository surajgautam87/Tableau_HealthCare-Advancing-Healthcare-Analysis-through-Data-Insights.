# Tableau_HealthCare-Advancing-Healthcare-Analysis-through-Data-Insights.
This project at HealthStat Solutions involved a comprehensive analysis of healthcare data using Tableau Prep, Tableau Public aimed at deriving actionable insights to enhance patient outcomes and optimize hospital operations. Through meticulous data preparation and advanced analysis techniques, we uncovered significant trends and patterns within the patient medical records and hospital treatment details datasets.

Key highlights include age group segmentation analysis, blood type distribution insights, and thorough examination of hospital stay duration and treatment costs. Our analysis also delved into gender-based and diagnosis-based comparisons, alongside room utilization and doctor's patient load evaluations. Furthermore, we explored recovery rating distributions and conducted predictive analysis for future billing amounts.

The culmination of our efforts was the development of an interactive and intuitive Tableau dashboard, presenting a cohesive narrative of the healthcare landscape. This dashboard offers stakeholders a holistic view of patient demographics, diagnosis distribution, treatment effectiveness, and hospital performance metrics. Through dynamic filters and visualizations, users can gain valuable insights and make informed decisions to drive improvements in patient care and hospital management.
